This is a simple web extraction demonstration. We extract the listed currency exchange rates to EURO in the page of [https://www.iban.com/exchange-rates](https://www.iban.com/exchange-rates), including   **Currency Codes**, **Currency Names**, and **Exchange Rates (= 1EUR)**. We can easily add one more field of current DateTime and save the data to databases such as MySQL, firebase, etc. to expand the application as an automatic exchange rate collection app.
